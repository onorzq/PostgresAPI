# postgres-api-project

Run /src/test/java/com/jackson/postgresapi/connection/ConnectivityTest.java FIRST!  
If ConnectivityTest.java not even work then other pieces of code definitely won't work.  

If the connection test pass, try /src/main/java/com/jackson/postgresapi/demo/PostgresApiDemo.java NEXT!  
If it works then you can start building your project using this api.  
Most of the use cases and tutorial are covered in the demo.

If you have any idea test it inside the /src/test/java/com/jackson/postgresapi/crud/CRUDTest.java first  
then put it into the main folder after suffcient tested. The code in the CRUDTest.java can be change arbitrary.  
but the code in the main folder should well design before actual implementing.

Good Luck!
